# Mobil-Group-2
Repository for our mobile application project.
Course is iDATA2503.

# Hjelp, jeg må på do!
In the pdf file in this directory, you will see our sketches 
for how we want our app. We think this will me quite a
big project, so we're not sure if we can implement it all, but
this is how we hope it will look.

#Pages
In our sketches, we have made an opening page, a login page, the toilet map and
reviews of chosen toilet, camera where you can take pictures of a toilet and
upload it to a previously marked toilet or a toilet you shared. 
We also have a search tab where you can search for toilets, and lastly a profile
page.
