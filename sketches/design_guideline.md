# Design guidelines

# Hjelp, jeg må på do!
In the pdf file in this directory, you will see our sketches 
for how we want our app. We think this will me quite a
big project, so we're not sure if we can implement it all, but
this is how we hope it will look.

#Pages
In our sketches, we have made an opening page, a login page, the toilet map and
reviews of chosen toilet, camera where you can take pictures of a toilet and
upload it to a previously marked toilet or a toilet you shared. 
We also have a search tab where you can search for toilets, and lastly a profile
page.

#Guidelines
Simplicity: The application is very simple. Not cluttered with text, only two colors that is white and blue, with shades of grey, and has an overall simplistic theme. The ‘montserrat’ font was to improve the simplicity and readability.

Navigability: The simplicity makes it easier for the users to navigate. Not too many options to confuse the user. 4 main tabs only, with pages the user might need.

Conventionality: Placed the main navigation at the bottom of the page, so they will always know where to find content, and it will be closest to their thumb.

Consistency: The overall “feel” of the website is replicated on all pages (e.g color, background, setup).


Accessibility: The application should be perceivable and understandable. It is also our goal to make it robust so that it works across several different devices.
