# Public_Toilet_Map

Have you ever experienced needing a toilet, but you're too far from home?
Look no further! Here's the app for you, developed specifically to bring you to the nearest toilet.

Here you also get the ability to add toilets to your current location using the add button,
or by using the search address option that puts a toilet marker on that exact address.

## Design guidelines
Simplicity: The application is very simple. Not cluttered with text, only the same matching color theme that is white, blue and dark blue, and has an overall simplistic theme. Styled font simplicity, but also readability.

Navigability: The simplicity makes it easier for the users to navigate. Not too many options to confuse the user. Small amount of main buttons.

Conventionality: Placed the main navigation at the top of the page, so they will always know where to find content, and the main action buttions at the bottom so they're closest to their thumb.

Consistency: The overall “feel” of the app is replicated on all pages (e.g color, background, setup).

Accessibility: The application should be perceivable and understandable. It is also our goal to make it robust so that it works across several different devices.
